                      <p>On this day in 2006, the late great Kobe Bryant had one of the greatest performances of all time, scoring 81 points on 21/33 two-point shots, 7/13 three-poitners, and 18/20 free throws in 41 minutes and 56 seconds. This game remains the highest scoring game in the shot clock era, only trailing Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point performance in 1962.</p>
