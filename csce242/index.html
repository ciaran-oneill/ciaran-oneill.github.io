        <p>This website is dedicated to my greatest inspiration. Hailing from Ireland, his smile brightens the lives of millions of people.  </p>
        <p>I first was blessed by the presence of the Tayto man when I visited Ireland in 2017. Browsing the chip section at a store, me and the Tayto Man crossed paths for the first time, and it was love at first sight. Before then, the only chip brands I knew were the same old boring ones in America - Doritos, Lays, Fritos, faceless corporations. Once I was done admiring the Tayto Man and ate his blessings, I realized I had made the greatest chip discovery of all time.</p>
