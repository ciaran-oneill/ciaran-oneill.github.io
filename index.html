                <p>This assignment introduced me to Flexblock, which taught me how to create custom website layouts. I also implemented media queries so that the page could be viewed in a mobile view. </p>

                <p>For this assignment, I used my newly acquired Fleckblock skills to change the look of my main page, including creating a container for assignments and giving them each their own block. This link will route back to this home page..</p>

                <p>This assignment challenged me to recreate a page from the UofSC website using my CSS and HTML skills. It was certainly a challenge, and I had to think about how to segment the page to make it match with the university page. </p>

                <p>This assignment was an introduction to JavaScript and adding interaction to my web pages. I learned how to link a script.js file to the index.html and add various interactive elements such as swapping images, rotating images, and adding images.</p>

                <img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image">
                <p>In Part 1 of the project, I selected my topic - NBA Nerds. I chose this topic because I love watching basketball and I am also fascinated by statistics, so I thought it could be fun creating a website combining the two.</p>

                <p>I used MockITT to create my first website prototype. I laid out the foundation for NBA Nerds, including creating a rough layout of each of the 5 pages including the display and some basic functionality.</p>

                <p>In part 3 of the project, I used my HTML and CSS skills in order to create the framework for my NBA Nerds website. I created the layout for all the pages using Flexblock with a basic color scheme that will be changed in the future.</p>
