        <h1> Welcome to Ciaran O'Neill's CSCE242 Page</h1>
        <p>This class, Web Applications, will strengthen my existing front-end web developing skills, such as HTML and CSS, and also allow me to learn more about back-end web development, which I do not have experience in. Also, after this semester is done I will hopefully have a cool website to look back on. I am excited to embark on this journey.</p>
